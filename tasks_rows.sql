Thanks again for your work on the site so far, it’s looking great. Just to give you an update on our side, we currently have our vet looking through all the copy. I will let you know if we have any edits there. We are also planning to have our content shoot on July 15th, so hopefully we can get some images and video to you by the end of July.

As for the look of our Services pages, we’d like to simplify the layout and reduce the number of images required. Specifically, we’d like to:

Keep the top section as is, including the banner photo, title, and full introductory text centred at the top of each page.
For the remainder of the page, we’d like to remove the alternating image and text sections and instead convert the content into accordion-style dropdowns that sit down the centre of the page.
Each accordion would feature a headline that opens to reveal the corresponding text. For example: “Why should I schedule an exam when my pet seems normal?” would expand to show the full explanation, and so on for the rest of the page content.

I’ve included a visual example below to help clarify the direction we’re aiming for. Let me know if you need anything else from us to get started on these changes.', '2025-07-04', '2025-07-07', null, '2025-07-07 07:46:55.135748+00'), ('24', '24', 'The client has got back to us with the below edits.

4) Why is there a small smile gallery on the homepage? Is this for SEO? Is there another reason? Otherwise remove it as the first page has too much content in my opinion



SMILE GALLERY:
1) Is there a benefit to the before/after pictures merged into each other with the right/left swipe feature vs before and after on top of each other or side by side without the swipe effect?
2) I will need to provide updating pricing for the procedures with price ranges listed.
3) I will provide some new before/after pictures

VIRTUAL CONSULT:
1) I am currently paying $199 for this outside service link that is integrated into my website. In the last 2 years I have received very few leads. I would like to cancel this outside service.
2) Can you design something very basic for me that collects patient name, email, phone and has them upload some selfie pictures of themselves and then forward it to northmiamidentist@yahoo.com for my review?


FLOATING HEADER:
1) I am paying for online scheduling with Local Med. I want to continue using this service and all the hyperlinks for anything related to scheduling an appointment should go to this widget.
2) There should be a section on the contact us page where potential patients can "Ask a Question" if they are not ready to schedule.

There is a folder in BOX called "team photos" that can be used to fix the first 3 points above.

4. our current website has a link and button for patients to review our membership plan with "Kleer" with the details of it. Can we carry that over to the new website please.
The link also allows new patients to sign up a membership plan without having to call us. they can do it directly from home and i think its important to have that on the website.

Team Page Updates

Replace the current “Meet the Team” photo banner with the same banner style as our Services page. Text should read “Meet the Team.” - image attached below

Please also remove the team photo at the bottom of the "Meet the Team" page.

Remove all instances of info@uppervillagevet.com from the website (e.g., Contact sections) to support our Google search efforts.

Add team member photos and bios for Celeste, Clare, Kiara, and Leslie. (bio''s and photo''s can be found here);
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XUc894MJm7jZNdQ06MvXx-na1XyCkYYo

Please update Samantha’s bio with the corrected copy provided. (Bio can be found here);
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HfJ2xF9oyiuKJNOfc1mkm8GoNXrMbUSqF1Hk0N3I7q4/edit?tab=t.0

I’ll follow up with a photo and bio for our new team member Lauren once ready.

New Client Promo Pages (Hidden)

We’d like to create several hidden pages, all following the structure of our Contact page with adjusted copy. These will support promo tracking via unique QR codes.

Hidden URLs to be created:

uppervillagevet.com/newclientpromo-doorhanger

uppervillagevet.com/newclientpromo-flyers

uppervillagevet.com/newclientpromo

uppervillagevet.com/newclientpromo-steve

uppervillagevet.com/poochparlour

All should lead to the same New Client Promo form/page (attached).

Submissions must go to info@uppervillagevet.com with the subject line “New Client Promo Inquiry.”

Additionally, each form should upload submissions to a Google Sheet specific to its source (e.g., Door Hanger inquiries → Door Hanger sheet).

Referral Check-in Page (Hidden)

Hidden URL: uppervillagevet.com/referral-checkin

Layout should follow the attached reference photo.

Submissions should upload to a Google Sheet and also send directly to nicole.reynolds@uppervillagevet.com (not info@).

I’ve re-attached the reference images and copy for the New Client Promo and Referral Check-in forms for clarity.

I’ve updated the main logo in the “box” files. Please remove the naming convention and center the logo emblem on the main page. The logo naming convention is going to be updated, but for now you can keep it at the top left only.

In the More Than A Name section, please replace the current image with Pic #39.

Some images appear pixelated. Is your team able to increase the resolution? Let me know if you need higher-resolution versions.

Please remove Kenneth’s image..

For the body part highlights, please return to the original creative direction shared in the beginning: grayish gradient with hover color. For the buttocks, please use the original submitted image. (refer to mocks in the BOX files)

Please change out the skin tightening image to "Extra Image 4".

For the service images, let’s use some of the new uploads:

Replace the peptide image with “Our Services 1.”

Replace the natural fat transfer image with “Briana” or “Heather.”

Replace the weight management image with “32” or “48.”

For thighs, use “Our Gallery 2.”

Let me know if you need clarification on any of these points, or if you’d like me to resend specific files to ensure resolution is correct.

Regarding the photos, there are some duplicate photos of the lobby which seem redundant. The new ones are those with the ClearCorrect Ortho poster included.

Also, the address on the website says 9784 W Yearling Rd B-1500 Peoria, AZ but does not have does not have STE B-1500.

I love that the Belleair website is now live. I really like the way it looks. I have one change that I would like. At first creation there was no african-american representation, then you guys changed it for me. And now after I have been looking at it for a week, I feel like there is too much and I would specifically like the Invisalign picture changed for a middle-aged Caucasian couple. Please make that change when you get the chance. Sorry about the change of heart, but it took me a while to decide that. Thank you.

- Low-res imagery on services, needs to be upscaled for mobile
- Lets move before/after''s and testimonials way up the page
- What''s the focus keyword for SEO here for non-brand? I don''t see anything really tying the H1 to any other header tags - other than oral health, but it should definitely be a dentist keyword ya? Or Family Dentist like in the title tag?
- In mobile this guy''s head gets cut off - Probably need a reformatted video so mobile has a better UX (mobile matters more than desktop)

Happy to meet to discuss further, but priority one is that the website converts and as-is the homepage is not SEO friendly for a specific keyword. If we''re going after a family dentist keyword, awesome, but then please share what the keyword set is and how this page is optimized for it so it drives leads

Some notes about the current version of the site:

1. On the home page there''s a photo of the old location building & it says, "Your Trusted Dental Service Provider!" This should be replaced with either a photo of our front office (as on our website), or a photo of the front of our building.
2. The $79 new patient special should changed to a $200 comprehensive specialist consultation fee as Dr Indech charges $200 instead of $79.
3. The photo on the home page with his old team (5 members) stating, "A dedicated team..." should be removed & not included as only 2 members of that team are still with us.
4. Everywhere it states that we''re in Phoenix should be changed to Scottsdale, i.e. on the homepage under "An oasis for state-of-the-art specialty care" toward the end of the paragraph below it says that our team in Phoenix is led by Drs Dan Indech, Terry Peterosn, etc. This should be updated to Scottsdale.
5. On the homepage when you click on read more about us the following corrections should be made:
a. "Gum disease care" should be underlined to follow the format of the other sections
b. Under "cosmetic periodontics" it should read "your gums not only effect," instead of "affect."
c. The section "dental implants" should be "Restorative dentistry" instead as that is what it is talking about, or the section should be re-worded to talk about dental implants.
6. Lets remove the patient forms sections as we don''t have a way for patients to fill out forms without them being sent to them electronically once the schedule.
7. On the "finance & insurance" page:
a. The first paragraph should be re-worded to say something about "due to our high-quality standards our office is 100% out-of-network with all insurance plans.
b. Paragraph 5 should state patient portions, instead of portion,s
c. Under payment options please add a hyper link to Sunbit (sunbit.com) prior to Care Credit
8. Please remove all current team members under the meet our team section & add our other hygienists from Brilliant Smiles Dentistry website. Also please add Dr Stephanie & I to the list of Drs bios.

That''s all I can see for now. Please let me know when these corrections have been made & we are ready to go live. I am excited to get this going as it looks great!

Hi Team,

We’d like to highlight Cherry as our primary financing option on our website. Cherry provides a Widget Builder that creates a widget customized with our branding. This will allow visitors to easily see financing options directly from our site.

Could you please:

1. Use this Widget Builder https://provider.withcherry.com/script-generator?applicationSlug=aaron-c-verbarg-dds-pc&businessName=Aaron+C+Verbarg+DDS+PC&industrySegment=dental to design our branded Cherry widget.
2. Implement both the full page and floating button on the site.
3. Let us know if you need placement guidance or if you run into any technical constraints.

This will help our website visitors understand financing options more easily, which should increase adoption.

Thank you for your help with this update!

1. Could you please have them center "Advanced Imaging for implant Success" under the "Dental Implants" section of the procedures overhead menu.
2. I appreciate that they updated the office photo on the homepage with the outside of our office, but is there any way that they can either do a split photo of the outside of our office & the main photo of our front desk that they have on our website as well, or include both images separately? I do want patients to know what the outside of our office looks like, but I know that the interior of our office is very inviting & is one of the many things that attracts a lot of our patients.
3. The changes I outlined before under the "patient info - Finance & Insurance" section of the site still have not been addressed as follows:
a. We still need to take out "Our office is in-network on some plans and out-of-network on other plans, but." We are out-of-network with all plans & thus it should read simply "We will provide administrative support with your insurance company to maximize your benefits for any recommended procedures."
b. Updated paragraph 5 to use “patient portions” instead of “portion,s.” this change has not been made.

I don''t mean to be too critical, but it seems as if only half of my previous changes were even looked at & the other half were ignored. I know that i am sometimes slow to look over changes as I want to be particular about things & I am very busy lately, but I would expect better attention to detail when I do take the time to list out the details.

Lana,

Here are some feedback items:

1. The banner picture on the homepage I want to be changed. We do not live in a big city, so this picture is very misleading. We need to use a photo that is a more small town feel.

2. The office hours are incorrect on the website: Our office hours are Monday - Thursday 7-4pm. We are closed Friday, Saturday and Sunday. This needs to be corrected on the home page and the “contact us” page.

3. The banner photos on the “Prophy” and “Periodontal Therapy” pages are a little scary for patients. I’d like something that looks more happy.

4. The photo of the man flossing on the “Bridges” page looks very fake (I think AI created it and it doesn’t look like he is flossing normally).

5. On the “Root Canal Treatment” page there is a photo that I don’t like. It is the photo of the patient with the clear safety glasses. This photo is unrealistic as well and needs to be changed to something more realistic and less scary.

6. On the “Tooth Extractions” page, the banner photo is scary. Please change to something happier.

7. On the “Retainers” page, the photo of the lady holding her red retainer with a metal key in the middle needs to be changed. That is not a an actual retainer. Please change for a different photo.

8. On the “Splint Therapy” page, please remove the photo of the lady inserting her large clear retainer. The splints I make are much smaller, and I don’t want patients to think they are that large.

9. On the “Contact Us” page, please add an email that patients can send questions to. The email is scheduling@enterprisefamilydental.com

10. I have created a Google Business Profile, so you should be able to include the Google Maps location on the website.

11. For the reviews that are on the website, I have active reviews on my Google profile now. So maybe you can link those as well.

Overall I like the website!

On the home page, we are changing the moving picture to a slider.
adding "CDCP", "Zoom Whitening", "Invisalign", "Comprehensive Dentistry"


Taglines that you can use:

Smiles Made Affordable with the Canadian Dental Care Plan - – Access the CDCP Today!

Brighten Your Smile with Professional Teeth Whitening – Safe, Fast, and Effective!”

Transform Your Smile Invisibly with Clear, Comfortable Invisalign Aligners

Comprehensive Dentistry: Complete, Convenient, Caring


Dilusha, I selected a few young family stock images that Dr Joe mentioned - family with young teenage kids

Check if any of these would look good for the CDCP slider, if not, can you find a nice stock photo? plus nice stock photos for the other sliders too.

Hi Lana,

I know it has been awhile since we last corresponded, but Dayana and I have spent the last few months writing out the verbiage and creating layouts for the website for what we are looking for. Our goal is to finish up at the end of January/beginning of February. The verbiage will be all finished and Dayana will provide several layouts so your design team knows exactly what we are looking for so they can continue to create the rest of the pages.

We are hoping that your design team can follow our layouts closely because we are going for a certain esthetic for the website. We will continue to review and provide feedback on the pages that are designed by your team, but we are hoping to be spending much less time of our own on the website because it has been a lot of work. All of the verbiage that has been written out is in our own words so it is important that it be kept the same.

Hopefully, we can get the website finalized in early spring so that we can start the process of becoming more visible on Google. We will let you know when we have uploaded all the information we have to the Box app.

Thanks,
